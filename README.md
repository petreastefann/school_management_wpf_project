# PROJECT DISCONTINUED DUE TO THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM'S FUNDS RUNNING OUT

### school_management_wpf_project
a project which aims to be a school management app.

### configuration
- create a database named school_management_db (or anything of your choice as long as you change the connection string in the appsettings.json file).
- that's it really.
- it has some bugs such as some unhandled exceptions or the fact that some fields do not change real-time, but its a good start


### roadmap

- [x] login

~~- [ ] register~~
- [x] change windows when succesfully logging in
- [x] move the logged user data to a specific View depending on their role
- [x] do each View
- [x] (ish) do the functionality of the each ViewModel (admin, teacher, user)
- [x] see that database
